# GMR Token v2
Create. Empower. Game.

## Security
With GAMER v2, we are taking security to another level. Using a Multi-Signature deployment strategy, through [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/), our GAMER v2 is the most secure GMR token to date. Multi-Signature, or multi-sig, decentralises the control and prevents a single point of failure. In essence, this means that three separate developers will control GAMER v2, with each developer required to sign every call made on the contract. Multi-sig also protects investors from potential risks associated with any loss of control over the deployer wallet, as there are essentially three deployer wallets.

## Governance
As the GMR project evolves and we develop new utilities for the GAMER token, we must have an accountable and community-driven decision-making process in place. With that in mind, Ryan Washington, the CEO, has pledged to introduce a community/developer governance community before May 4th 2022. The GMR community will be consulted in the weeks and months leading up to May 4th 2022.

We're bringing the gaming community together with exclusive content, premium creator partnerships, NFTs and more. By gamers, for gamers!
