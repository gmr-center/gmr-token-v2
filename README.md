# GMR Token v2
Create. Empower. Game.

## Security
With GAMER v2, we are taking security to another level. Using a Multi-Signature and timelock ownership structure, through [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/defender), our GAMER v2 is the most secure GMR token to date.

### Mutli-signature
Multi-signature, or multisig, decentralises control and prevents a single point of failure. In essence, this means that three separate developers will control GAMER v2 (via our timelock contract), with each developer required to sign every call made on the contract. Multi-sig also protects investors from potential risks associated with any loss of control over the deployer wallet, as there are essentially three deployer wallets.

### Timelock
The GAMER v2 token [contract](https://bscscan.com/address/0xADCa52302e0a6c2d5D68EDCdB4Ac75DeB5466884) is no longer owned by the deployer wallet, and is now owned and managed through our timelock [contract](https://bscscan.com/address/0xc89d441f25DA499628D19A59b0c2A62481eCC4c8#code), which is in turn "owned" by our [multisig wallet](https://bscscan.com/address/0x938668B8231140b1D9fE4eda3eb1582060f6D29E#code). You can find the ownership transfer transaction details below.

#### Delayed executions
The most important aspect of the timelock contract is that any functions called, on the token contract, are delayed by a minimum of **two days**. This gives investors ample time to sell off tokens and leave the project should the administrators of the multisig wallet try to make a call that will harm investors.

Although we are confident that our minting schedule has the correct limits and restrictions, a hypothetical scenario might be that the multisig admins decide to mint too many tokens that will harm the price. In this scenario, once the minting has been proposed, the contract will be unable to execute the call for **two days**. Which will allow investors the time necessary to leave the project.

### A note on minting
As you will know, right from the start, we have promised that gamers will be able to participate in play to earn, staking, and even more innovative ways to game while being rewarded.

To make this possible, we will introduce a secure, restricted, and ultimately community governed minting schedule. Any minting is restricted until May 4th 2022, our anniversary. It will be governed by a 5-year blockchain-based minting schedule, limiting and gradually reducing the number of tokens that can be minted in any given year. The hard cap baked into the minting schedule sets the ceiling for total mints in a given year.

Any decision to mint will be subjected to our developer/community governance committee and mechanisms, and of course, the restriction imposed through our multisig and timelock security measures. Meaning any successful execution to mint will have been proposed, voted on and ultimately delayed for a minimum of two days.

## Governance
As the GMR project evolves and we develop new utilities for the GAMER token, we must have an accountable and community-driven decision-making process in place. With that in mind, Ryan Washington, the CEO, has pledged to introduce a community/developer governance community before May 4th 2022. The GMR community will be consulted in the weeks and months leading up to May 4th 2022.
